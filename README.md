# Browser Startpage
Aesthetically pleasing, minimal startpage; currently based on [catppuccin theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).

If you've used the Brave Browser before, you'll know that you cannot directly set the home or new tab background to what you want. If you turn off the crypto ads that are displayed on the home page, it will instead display a, *purposely* annoying, bright pink background. To work around this, I'd rather *not* use some bloated extension just to set a wallpaper; therefore, I made my own simple extension (specifically for chromium based browsers) that sets the home/new tab page to a static website based on the html/css/js you write and upload - and this repo contains its source.

For firefox, though, signing extensions seemed like a big hassle, and thus gave up on that idea. Which is also the main reason for hosting this repo as a static website via github; unlike Brave Browser, Firefox allows you to set the home/new tab page to a specific link - this repo would end up being that link, thereby giving you the landing page previewed below.
- Set Firefox home/new tab to land on `https://yuuushio.github.io/startpage.github.io/`
